# Citrus Starter

Citrus is (yet another) JS starter for small projects with simple needs.

It comes built in with React and Express, and integrates with MongoDB.

On the front end, it has axios, swr, and SCSS.

It's designed to be as simple as possible and has only one `node_modules` folder since it does not expect many dependencies.

## Install

1. To start with a Citrus template, simply run this script on your terminal.

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ranjithrd/nitrate.git NAME
        cd NAME
        curl -sSL https://bit.ly/citrussh | bash
    ```

2. Once prompted, enter the project name and hit enter. 

3. That's it! Find your project located in a new directory, and get coding.

## Commands

While working on your project, use the command 

```bash
yarn cli debug
```

Once you're ready to test your deployment, run this command

```bash
yarn cli start
```
